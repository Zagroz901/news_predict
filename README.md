# News Prediction Project 📰📊

## Overview
This project is developed as part of my training at **Qafza**. The goal is to build a **news prediction system**, but instead of focusing solely on model training and accuracy, we emphasized **MLOps principles**, clean code, structured file organization, and deployment automation.

## Features
✅ **Well-structured and modular code** following best software engineering practices.  
✅ **Automated training and deployment workflows** to ensure a scalable and maintainable system.  
✅ **FastAPI-based API** for serving predictions efficiently.  
✅ **Integration with MLflow** for model tracking and experiment logging.  
✅ **Advanced NLP techniques** using **spaCy** and **NLTK** for text preprocessing.  
✅ **XGBoost model** for news classification and prediction.  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI ⚡  
- **Model Tracking & Experimentation:** MLflow 📊  
- **Natural Language Processing:** spaCy, NLTK 📝  
- **Machine Learning Model:** XGBoost 🚀  

## Future Enhancements 🚀
We plan to enhance the project with additional MLOps features, including:
- **Docker** 🐳 for containerization and easy deployment.
- **DVC (Data Version Control)** ⚡ to efficiently manage and track dataset versions.
- **BERT-based Models** 🤖 for improved text understanding and classification.
